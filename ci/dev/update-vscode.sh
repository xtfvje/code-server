# Description: This is a script to make the process of updating vscode versions easier
# Run it with `yarn update:vscode` and it will do the following:
# 1. Check that you have a remote called `vscode`
# 2. Ask you which version you want to upgrade to
# 3. Grab the exact version from the package.json i.e. 1.53.2
# 4. Fetch the vscode remote branches to run the subtree update
# 5. Run the subtree update and pull in the vscode update
# 6. Commit the changes (including merge conflicts)
# 7. Open a draft PR

# This function expects two arguments
# 1. the vscode version we're updating to
# 2. the list of merge conflict files

## TODOS

- [ ] test editor locally
- [ ] test terminal locally
- [ ] make notes about any significant changes in docs/CONTRIBUTING.md#notes-about-changes

## Files with conflicts (fix these)
