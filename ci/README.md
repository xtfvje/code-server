# ci

This directory contains scripts used for code-server's continuous integration infrastructure.

Some of these scripts contain more detailed documentation and options
in header comments.

Any file or directory in this subdirectory should be documented here.

- [./ci/lib.sh](./lib.sh)
  - Contains code duplicated across these scripts.

## Publishing a release

Make sure you have `$GITHUB_TOKEN` set and [hub](https://github.com/github/hub) installed.

1. Update the version of code-server and make a PR.
   1. Update in `package.json`
   2. Update in [./docs/install.md](../docs/install.md)
   3. Update in [./ci/helm-chart/README.md](../ci/helm-chart/README.md)
      - Remember to update the chart version as well on top of appVersion in `Chart.yaml`.
      - Run `rg -g '!yarn.lock' -g '!*.svg' '3\.7\.5'` to ensure all values have been
        changed. Replace the numbers as needed.
        - You can install `rg` or `ripgrep` on macOS [here](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/ripgrep).
   4. Update the code coverage badge (see [here](#updating-code-coverage-in-readme) for instructions)
   5. Update the docs badge in [./README.md](../README.md)
2. GitHub actions will generate the `npm-package`, `release-packages` and `release-images` artifacts.
   1. You do not have to wait for these.
3. Run `yarn release:github-draft` to create a GitHub draft release from the template with
   the updated version.
   1. Summarize the major changes in the release notes and link to the relevant issues.
   2. Change the @ to target the version branch. Example: `v3.9.0 @ Target: v3.9.0`
4. Wait for the artifacts in step 2 to build.
5. Run `yarn release:github-assets` to download the `release-packages` artifact.
   - It will upload them to the draft release.
6. Run some basic sanity tests on one of the released packages.
   - Especially make sure the terminal works fine.
7. Make sure the github release tag is the commit with the artifacts. This is a bug in
   `hub` where uploading assets in step 5 will break the tag.
8. Publish the release and merge the PR.
   1. CI will automatically grab the artifacts and then:
      1. Publish the NPM package from `npm-package`.
      2. Publish the Docker Hub image from `release-images`.
9. Update the AUR package.
   - Instructions on updating the AUR package are at [cdr/code-server-aur](https://github.com/cdr/code-server-aur).
10. Wait for the npm package to be published.
11. Update the [homebrew package](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/code-server.rb).
    1. Install [homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
    2. Run `brew bump-formula-pr --version=3.8.1 code-server` and update the version accordingly. This will bump the version and open a PR. Note: this will only work once the version is published on npm.

## Updating Code Coverage in README

Currently, we run a command to manually generate the code coverage shield. Follow these steps:

1. Run `yarn test:unit` and make sure all the tests are passing
2. Run `yarn badges`
3. Go into the README and change the color from `red` to `green` in this line:

```
![Lines](https://img.shields.io/badge/Coverage-46.71%25-red.svg)
```

NOTE: we have to manually change the color because the default is red if coverage is less than 80. See code [here](https://github.com/olavoparno/istanbul-badges-readme/blob/develop/src/editor.ts#L24-L33).
