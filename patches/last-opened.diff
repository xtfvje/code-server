Remove last opened functionality

This conflicts with our own handling of the last opened workspace.  If we wanted
to switch to this we would need to pass through the disable-last-opened flag and
respect it here then remove our own redirction code that handles this.

Our version might be better anyway since it puts the workspace in the URL.
